# Automated Underwriting Risk Assessment System

This repository contains an automated underwriting system that evaluates insurance applications and determines **acceptance**, **rejection**, or **need for additional information** based on a combination of:

‚úÖ **Rule-based logic**  
‚úÖ **Machine Learning risk scoring**

---

## üöÄ **Project Overview**

Insurance underwriting is the process of assessing risk and determining whether to approve or reject an application. This project automates the underwriting process using:

1. **Rules Engine:** Implements underwriting guidelines such as age limits, occupation risk, smoker status, and medical report requirements.
2. **ML Risk Scoring:** Uses a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the risk category based on historical data.

## üß† **How it Works**

1. **Application intake**: Receives structured application data as input.
2. **Rules evaluation**: Applies business rules to determine eligibility.
3. **ML risk scoring**: Computes risk probability using a trained Decision Tree Classifier.
4. **Decision output**: Returns `Accept`, `Reject`, or `Needs Additional Information` with reasons.

## üíª **Running the Notebook**

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SoniaJanyavula3101/Risk-Assessment-for-New-Policy-Applications.git
